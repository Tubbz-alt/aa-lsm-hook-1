aa-lsm-hook-compile(8) -- compile AppArmor cache
================================================


## SYNOPSIS

`aa-lsm-hook-compile`


## DESCRIPTION

`aa-lsm-hook-compile` is a system binary used during system update transactions
to compile the AppArmor profiles into a cache for Ahead Of Time (AoT) compilation.
This cache is then read by `aa-lsm-hook-load(8)` on boot to maintain fast boot times
while still correctly loading AppArmor profiles early.

`aa-lsm-hook-compile` does not take any arguments, and is intended to be executed
by the service file.

## EXIT STATUS

On success, 0 is returned. A non-zero return code signals a failure.
